# Back Directory

This directory should contain your card back image(s).

If no image is provided, `create_pdf.py` will use a blank back.

The image should be in portrait orientation and cropped.

The image can be in any image file format.

If you want to make double-sided cards, you need to provide images in [`double_sided/`](../double_sided/) directory. See [here](../../README.md#double-sided-cards) for more information.
