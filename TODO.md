[ ] `create_pdf.py` 
    [?] Place functionality into `create_pdf.py`
    [+] Properly notate constants
    [ ] Convert to use 'pathlib'
    [+] Add per-folder card back image selection
    [ ] Add per-slot card back to PDF


[ ] IMPORTANT NOTE: Removed warnings for double-sided cards. Card backs are matched to fronts, so having unmatched backs in double-sided isn't a big deal. If this is important, it can be added back, although it would require a refactor.
